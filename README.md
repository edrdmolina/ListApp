# ListApp
A simple app used to create lists for everyday tasks. 
Such as grocery shopping or performing errands at home.
### Made with:
- Mongo Atlas
- Express JS
- Heroku
- EJS
- Bootstrap 4.6

### What I learned:
Creating an Express App from scratch using ejs and mongoose. I was able to add jQuery to the front end to include single page app like qualities. When crossing off items on a list you send a put request to an API that updates the item status as checked or un-checked. Thus, saving the progress done during shopping.
